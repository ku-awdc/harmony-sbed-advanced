## Overview and disclaimers {.fragile}

The development version of runjags::template_huiwalter contains some modifications/extra features that you may find useful - this bonus material gives you a quick introduction to how to implement some of the things that I will present at the SBED conference (Thursday morning).  See the following link to get started:  <https://www.costmodds.org/projects/template_huiwalter/>
